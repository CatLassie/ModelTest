When working on summarization tasks on a laptop with an NVIDIA RTX4070 (which typically has around 8–12 GB of VRAM), you’ll want models that offer a good balance between performance and resource efficiency. Here are some popular options on Hugging Face:

---

### **1. DistilBART for Summarization**

- **Model:** [sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6](https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6)
- **Overview:** This is a distilled version of Facebook’s BART model fine-tuned on the CNN/DailyMail dataset. It’s significantly lighter than the full BART-large model, making it more practical for a laptop setup.
- **Pros:**  
  - Lower memory usage and faster inference.
  - Good summarization quality for news and similar content.
- **Cons:**  
  - Might be slightly less accurate than the full BART-large model in some cases.

### **2. BART Large CNN (with caution)**

- **Model:** [facebook/bart-large-cnn](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn)
- **Overview:** A very popular and high-quality summarization model fine-tuned on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.
- **Pros:**  
  - Produces high-quality summaries.
- **Cons:**  
  - Resource-intensive—may require careful management of batch size and sequence length to run on an RTX4070 with limited VRAM.
  - If you experience out-of-memory errors, consider switching to the distilled variant above.

### **3. T5-based Models**

- **Model:** [t5-base](https://huggingface.co/t5-base) or [google/flan-t5-base](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base)
- **Overview:** T5 models can be used for summarization tasks by framing the problem as a text-to-text task. For instance, you provide a prompt like “summarize:” followed by the document, and the model returns a summary.
- **Pros:**  
  - Flexible: the T5 framework can be adapted to many tasks, including summarization.
  - Generally lighter than the largest variants (like t5-large or t5-3b).
- **Cons:**  
  - May require a bit of prompt engineering.
  - Depending on your dataset and length of documents, you might need to split documents into manageable chunks.

### **Tips for Running on an RTX4070 Laptop:**

- **Batch Size & Sequence Length:**  
  Adjust these parameters to avoid exceeding your GPU’s memory limits. Start with smaller batch sizes and shorter maximum sequence lengths, then gradually increase as your setup allows.

- **Mixed Precision Inference:**  
  Use frameworks like Hugging Face’s Transformers with mixed-precision (FP16) to reduce memory usage and potentially speed up inference.

- **Model Quantization or Distillation:**  
  If you’re still running into resource constraints, consider using further distilled or quantized versions of the models.

### **Conclusion**

For a balance of efficiency and quality on an RTX4070 laptop, **sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6** is an excellent choice for summarization tasks. Alternatively, if you prefer T5-based models, **t5-base** or **flan-t5-base** are strong candidates that are more lightweight than their larger counterparts.

Each of these models has been used successfully in summarization tasks and should run reasonably well on your hardware with proper configuration.
